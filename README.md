# UCF Introductory Physics Labs
These Jupyter notebooks are for use in the undergraduate physics labs at UCF. You can run the notebooks in Google Colab (requires a Google login, though) or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run Jupyter locally on your computer. To download a notebook and run in locally, right-click or command-click the download link and select "save as".  
  
- **Intro to Jupyter**: start here if you haven't used a Juypter notebook before. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/UCF_labs/blob/main/intro.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/adamlamee/UCF_labs/raw/main/intro.ipynb).  
- **Analysis practice**: Read in a data file, make some plots, and do some analysis. [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/UCF_labs/blob/main/analysis_practice.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/adamlamee/UCF_labs/raw/main/analysis_practice.ipynb).  

<!--
- **Making Comparisons**: [open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/UCF_labs/blob/main/making_comparisons.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/adamlamee/UCF_labs/raw/main/making_comparisons.ipynb).  
- **Fitting a Model**: [open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adamlamee/UCF_labs/blob/main/fitting_a_model.ipynb) or [download](https://github.com/adamlamee/UCF_labs/raw/main/fitting_a_model.ipynb).
