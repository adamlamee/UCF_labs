# UCF_labs
These Jupyter notebooks are for use in the undergraduate physics labs at UCF. If you haven't coded in a Jupyter notebook before or need a refresher, start with  **Intro to Jupyter** below.  

You can run the notebooks in Google Colab (saving requires a Google login) or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to run Jupyter locally on your computer.
